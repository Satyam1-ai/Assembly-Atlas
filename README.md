# Assembly Development Lab

This repository is where I am building my comprehensive x86-64 assembly skills. I will be updating this repository on the go with new code and projects.

## **Project Structure:**

*   ### **`/Standard-Library/`**
    *   A custom library developed purely in assembly language. The goal is to recreate basic functionalities found in C/C++ STL, such as printing integers/strings, input reading, and general data manipulation routines.

*   ### **`/Linux-Internals/`**
    *   Implementations and experiments based on concepts from various Linux programming books (kernel handshakes, syscall usage, memory management, etc.). This section explores low-level OS interaction.

*   ### **`/Practice/`**
    *   Simple, foundational practice programs and algorithms. This includes solutions to coding challenges (like Codeforces questions) and basic assembly exercises.
