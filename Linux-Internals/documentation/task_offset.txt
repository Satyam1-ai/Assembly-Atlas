The task offset is essentially what the kernel uses to figure out the offset .
Everytime ...a process is being created ..it will get stored in the ...struct_task ..This will help figure out how the CPU will read the process
in the struct_task you will be haivng fields like ..process id ...numbers ..then userID ..the pointer to the mm_struct ..and even the TASK_KSTACK .
We are defining all of this ..in the offset file ..which will be calling upon in subsequent programs ..
especially relating to the task struct that unix based systems use ..
