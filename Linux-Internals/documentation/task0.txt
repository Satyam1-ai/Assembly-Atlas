Created a task 0 ..
initialised with ..different fields based on how ..a struct_task is defined ..
I did only use the ....a singly linked list for now ...to keep it lesss messy 
But as we move forward ..i will keep modifying the code to include ..the ..
circular doubly linked list ..and to handle over 128 cores ..


Here i have used the ..dq as in 8 bytes for each ...but we could definitely optimize it much further ..
The use of current_pointer is a way to inform the ..CPU ..that this is the current task I am execucting ....every time a context-swtich happens we could use this definition ..
Next we defined the ..mm's location as ...0x1000 why ??

Simple reason the mm is just a memory location for the tasks ..Think of each process as a box ..where the CPU allocates ..1 box for each process ..These boxes are all of the size . 4096 bytes ...
each process thinks he is king...But this is a separate topic called paging ..whcih I will discuss later ..


And i have defined the box to start from ..0x1000 becasue that is the 4096 in the hex format ..We could have started from 0 but instead we just move one step becasur the BIOS i loaded and uses  the first 4096bytes 
when hardware is initliazed .....just to be safe ..we skip the first box entirely
